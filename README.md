This is a plug-in for a chat bot client.

It lets people in the chat room play a game with acronyms.

I did not originate the acronym game or the chat bot but this implementation is completely 
fresh.

### Hey, uh, the tabs switch a lot

Yes. I know. There's nothing that can be done about it. It's a design choice on their end 
and they're sticking to it. It basically makes games like this unusable.

### Thanks

Big thanks to testers: D, J, J, N, M, & E
